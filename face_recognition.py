#Description: This program detects faces, and eyes.

# Face detection is performed by using classifiers.
# A classifier is essentially an algorithm that decides whether a given image is positive(face)
# or negative(not a face). We will use the Haar classifier which was named after the Haar wavelets
# because of their similarity. The Haar classifier employs a machine learning algorithm called
# Adaboost for visual object detection

#Read in the img
img = cv2.imread('DataSets/Faces/dwayne_and_james.jpg') # The image is transformed into a numpy array
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(img, 1.3, 5) #returns the position of the detected faces as Rect(x,y,w,h), #face_cascade.detectMultiScale(img, scalefactor, minNeighbors)

#scalefactor In a group photo, there may be some faces which are near the camera than others. Naturally, such faces would appear more
# prominent than the ones behind. This factor compensates for that.

#minNeighbors This parameter specifies the number of neighbors a rectangle should have to be called a face.

# Print the number of faces found
print('Faces found: ', len(faces))

#Images which recorded in visible wavelengths contain 3 bands or  3 channels called RGB. NOTE: Open CV uses BGR
# R = red , G = green and B = blue. When overlapping these three bands,
# you can see an image in true color similar what people see.
print('The image height, width, and channel: ',img.shape) #Get the number of rows & cols AKA the height & width of the image 
print('The coordinates of each face detected: ', faces) #Print the coordinates of each face found

#loop over all the coordinates faces returned and draw rectangles around them using Open CV.
#We will be drawing a green rectangle with a thickness of 2

    roi_face = img[y:y + h, x:x + w] #Get the pixel coordinates within the detected face border the region of interest (ROI), because eyes are located on the face
    eyes = eye_cascade.detectMultiScale(roi_face) #returns the position of the detected eyes
    for (ex, ey, ew, eh) in eyes: #loop over all the coordinates eyes returned and draw rectangles around them using Open CV.
