# Description: This is a virtual assistant program that gets the date, the current time, responds back with a random greeting, and 
#             returns information on a person from wikipedia e.g. 'who is LeBron James'

# DEF: A virtual assistant is an application that can understand voice commands and complete tasks for a user.
